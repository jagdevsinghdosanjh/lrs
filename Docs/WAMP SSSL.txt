Following are some easy steps to setup enviroment to use HTTPS on WAMP.

**It is Important that you have already got WAMP installed, If not you can download WAMP from [here](https://www.wampserver.com/en/).**
 
 After you've downloade and installed WAMP; the steps are as follows,
 
 ## STEP 1: Download and Install OpenSSL.
 Both 32 and 64-bit versions of OpenSSL are available. Make sure you're using the right installation for your Windows version.
 The most recent version of OpenSSL may be found [here](https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html). **When Installing OpenSSL leave all settings default.**

## STEP 1: Generate Private Key and SSL certficate.

* Load Command Prompt as an Administrator from your start menu and run the commands below.
To begin, navigate to the directory where OpenSSL was installed.

   `cd c:/program files/openssl-win64/bin/`

* Generate your Private key by using follwing command.You will be asked for a passphrase. Make it anything you want just make sure you remember it for the next step.

  `openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private.key 2048`

  `openssl rsa -in private.key -out private.key`

* Now, create your Certificate thorough following commad,You will be asked several questions on this step. You can put whatever you like or just hit enter to leave it at default.
   - **The only one that really matters is Common Name (e.g. server FQDN) you will need to type “localhost” for this.**

  `openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -key private.key -out certificate.crt -days 36500`

## STEP 2: Move your KEY and Certificate.


* Create a folder named **"KEY"** in the directory    **C:\wamp64\bin\apache\apache2.4.51\conf**


* Copy the generated `private.key` and `certificate.crt` files from **C:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin**
 to the **C:\wamp64\bin\apache\apache2.4.27\conf\key** folder.
 
 
 ## Step 5: Edit Your httpd.conf File
 
 * Open **c:/wamp64/bin/apache/apache2.4.41/conf/httpd.conf** and un-comment (remove the #) the following 3 lines:

    `LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so`
  
    `Include conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf`
  
    `LoadModule socache_shmcb_module modules/mod_socache_shmcb.so`
  
  
## Step 6: Edit Your httpd-ssl.conf File

* Open **c:/wamp64/bin/apache/apache2.4.41/conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf** and change all the parameters to the ones shown below.

```
 DocumentRoot "c:/wamp64/www"
 ServerName localhost:443
 ServerAdmin admin@example.com
 ErrorLog "${SRVROOT}/logs/error.log"
 TransferLog "${SRVROOT}/logs/access.log"
 SSLSessionCache "shmcb:${SRVROOT}/logs/ssl_scache(512000)"
 SSLCertificateFile "${SRVROOT}/conf/key/certificate.crt"
 SSLCertificateKeyFile "${SRVROOT}/conf/key/private.key"
 CustomLog "${SRVROOT}/logs/ssl_request.log"
 ```
* The DocumentRoot folder is the location where the website files are located. The ServerName can be set as **localhost"** or the name set to access the website like **"example.com"**
 
 # Step 7: Restart WampServer
 
* Everything should be set up now. Make sure you restart WampServer for the changes to take effect. 
* If there will be any syntax error, you can check it by navigating to  **c:/wamp64/bin/apache/apache2.4.41/bin** in Command Prompt and run following command;

  `httpd -t `
 
 **You should now be able to access your website with HTTPS / SSL enabled.**
